I am developing a website in vercel and I have deployed my prototype.
I have uploaded my typescript files with extension of ts or tsx in artifact. 
Please note that the file named so it reflect the directory tree. For example components - home - testimonials.tsx refers to components/home/testimonials.tsx. 
Now please show me the directory trees including all of the files

Next, for all new subsequent file name must use lower case and for file imports please use alias and for all subsequent command line if possible please us pnpm
